# udacity-data-wrangling

>Real-world data rarely comes clean. This is why in this project Python and its libraries will be used to gather data all associated with Twitter's @dog_rates account from a variaty of sources and in a variety of formats. The three datasets retrieved will be assessed for quality and tidyness, followed by analsis.

>@dog_rates is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog. These ratings almost always have a denominator of 10, with the numerators mostly greater than 10. Example, 13/10, 12/10. @dog_rates also known as WeRatDogs has over 4 million followers and has received international media coverage.

>The purpose of this project is to wrangle data from @dog_rates, find and fix 8 quality issues and 2 tidyness issues, analyse the data to find patterns and insights of interest.

>Please feel free to go through the 'wrangle_report' file for more about the datasets used and the process of analysis, and 'act_report' for the report on findings.
